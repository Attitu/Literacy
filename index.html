		 			<p>When we thinsk of digital literacy, we usually think of research–finding, evaluating, and properly crediting digital sources. The “research” connotation makes sense, as it is the sheer volume of sources and media forms on the “internet” that stand out.</p>
		 			<p>Literacy can be reduced to the ability to make sense of ideas. This often means reading, but also viewing, observing, writing, creating, designing–each a kind of literacy, and each with nuanced fluencies of their own.</p>
		 			<p>According to Cornell University “Digital literacy is the ability to find, evaluate, utilize, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet.”</p>
		 			While going through the digital literacy class on tree house, this were but afew sub topics that stood out for me.

						<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
						<p><strong>Application</strong>is a software tha can be used to write a code.
		                Application that ar used to process code are called <strong>programming softaware</strong>.Examples of programming software are-:
						<ul>
							<li>Text editor</li>
							<li>Debuggers</li>
							<li>Compilers</li>
							<li>Linkers</li>
						</ul>
		                </p>
						<p>Machine language are he lwest language as i works direcly with the hardware without using the compiler. Higher language on the other hand, are easy to read<br>
						In order to make a higher language a lower language, it has o go through a compilor make it binay &lpar;<em>binay are always witha base 2 e.g 2&sup2;&equals;4</em>	<br>
						<p><strong>Paradigm</strong> is awa of doing something. Programmming paradigm are:procedural &lpar; astep by step way of doing something &rpar; fuctional &lpar;in functional program, you look at the program in a mathemaatical way i.eyou receive the input information and use hat information o create an output suc as that of racket scheme.</p>

							<h2 id="wire">Introduction to Wireframing</h2>
							<p>
								<em>Wireframe</em> is a drawing that visualizes a website or  mobile app. I focuses onthe structure and the functionality<br>
							    Some of the benefits of wireframing include: <em>Brain storm ideas before polishing, Get feedback on the content, without visual creating biases, Get feedback and stakeholder approval early, Serves time and There is low pressure</em>

			                <p>
			                Wireframes are based<strong>fedility</strong>, that is, amount of content/detail.

			                	<em>Lower fedility</em> - in this, there are minimal content. It focuses on the the layout and hierachy of the content while <em>high fedility </em>is more specific and realistic e.g uses the actual copy.
			                

			                <strong>Thumbnail</strong> it ranges in the scope and size. This is the default and it is full size. One of the shortcoming of thumbnail is that it is small and does not involve details.

			                <strong>How to draw a wireframe</strong>
			                <p>Review the users research and the basic goals, Iterate on low fedility wireframe, Get internal feedback, Iterate again, Polish on the feedback,Get feedback again and Get users feedback<br>          

			                Some of wireframes include: balmasqu, drawing, sketching and adobe xd. The last two are the best to use, because  they can be easily translated to a mockup

					<h3 id="intro">Introduction to HTML</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>HTML</strong> stands for hypertext markup language. <em>Hypertext</em> m,eans that any text can be displayed in a computer screens can can contain links to other computers.<br>
						<strong>Markup language</strong> provide structure. The information in the head does not appear in the browser but it does appear in the search engine.HTML5 help us to use tags that clearly defines differen section of the body such as: <em>header</em> which in most cases contain logo, name of the company, main navigation menu e.t.c.<em>Main</em> contain the main content and the <em>footer</em> contain the copyright information, oher links, social media links e.t.c.<br>
						HTML provide meaning in structure to content. <em>Semantic</em> is the meaning behind a word or a phrase such as header,  main, section, article, footer e.t.c.
						<em>section</em> is used to group related information. It starts with a heading and it can occur anywhere.<br>
						<em>Article</em> contains a single entry that add up to th amin entry. It is a self contained information.
						<em>Nav tag</em> refers o a set of related navigation links. It is used for major navigation such as in th header and footer.<em>Aside tag</em> is related to he main content but it can be removed without affecting the main content.<br>
	                    <strong>Note</strong>You can always have multiple headers and footers in a page.
					</p>


					 <div class="paths">
						<h3 id="path">File Path</h3>
						<p>
							Linking to a part of a pag is a two step process i.e identiying the part you want to linka and idenifying the partyu want to link to.<br>To link to another pageyou have to idenify the <em>file path</em>  bfore writing the pound sign &lpar; document relative path&rpar;.<br>
							<em>Root relativ path</em> is a path from the root of the main documentto a fil on that site. To write it, you need to start with a forward &quot;&sol;&quot; e.g <a href="/#about"></a>. When using it, you don't need to write he whle path; it only works when web links are uploaded on a webserver or when you have a local server running on your computer.

			         <footer>
				       	<div class="comment">
							Comments are used by developers so that they can understand code after visiting it after a certain period of time. They are also helpful to other developers who might be visiting the page. They can be helful in showing where a code starts and where it ends.<br>
							shortcut for creating a comment is:<br>
							ctrl &plus;&sol;<br>
